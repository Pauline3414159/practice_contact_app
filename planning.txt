# goal 

  - solidfy everything we learned in the back end :)
  - - Basic database-driven Contact Manager Application for individuals
  - incorporate many of the tools and (code types??) presented in lessons
    - Write Rake tasks
    - Use Ajax/JQuery, Javascript, 

# Define Requirements

# Iteration #1

  - Create application in the simplest way possible. 
  - Include basic database operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete 
    - create a database to store our contacts
      - SQL?? Session until we develop know-how of SQL?
    - list all the contacts in the database (I could draw a picture but this is what the homepage would look like)
      - Home                                    sign-up / log-in
        -edit-delete/ id / first name/ last name/ phone/ email

    - delete an existing contact in the database
  - methods
    - create_contact
    - delete_contact
    - edit_contact
    - get_contact
    - list_contacts

# Iteration #2

  - Improve appearance of application

# Iteration #3

  - Add form validation.
  - Prevent user from submitting a form without completing required form fields.
  - validate email/phone number/address for Create New Contact
  - Error Messages
    - first name is required
    - last name is required
    - invalid phone number
    - invalid email address
  - name logic: length greater than zero
  - phone logic: length greater than 0, if value exists, then match a reqular expression
  - email logic: length greater than 0, if value exists...

  -validating phone, email, addresses

# Iteration #4

 - create unit tests Using a Mock Object Framework (Rack::Test)
 - Create Rake  function to run tests

# Iteration #5

  - Practice Test-Driven Development (write test first, write code against it)
    - write unit test that fails
    - write sloppy-created fast code that passes the unit test
    - refactor code
  - User functions
    - view the list of contact groups
    - create a new contact group
    - delete a contact group
    - display ....
    - another user function...
    - ect.

# Iterationo #6

  - first-last name/ address/ phone/ email/ birthday/ category

   display screen - have options to display only certial types of contact 
    or to search for a contacts - you can select a contanct from there
